## Background

This gem is significantly inspired by, and structurally similar to, [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth). It is the result of research conducted by Pavilion in the [NGI DAPSI program](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/), specifically:

> A study of the existing calendar event standards, and attempts to develop a standard calendar event data model, including a comparative analysis of the current data models of popular event-related services.

The research and its associated data will be made publicly available in the coming months.
